I've created a button that will automatically deploy a copy of this application to Heroku for you at the click of a button\r\n\r\nTo find your Slack credentials, go [here](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.getPresence/test)\r\n\r\nClick on your @username, and press Test Method\r\n\r\nYou will want to note the token and user generated in the URL Slack provides.\r\n\r\n![Slack Credentials](https://github.com/juliangarritano/ethanifier-android/raw/master/images/get_presence.png)\r\n\r\nTo deploy your web app, click this handy button below\r\n\r\n[![Deploy](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12450961/9590632/ef92ff16-5003-11e5-8eb3-5c7272a31621.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/juliangarritano/ethanifier-server)\r\n\r\nOnce you've created an account and deployed your application, you'll want to configure it with your Slack credentials\r\n\r\nClick on the Manage App button\r\n\r\n![Manage App](https://github.com/juliangarritano/ethanifier-android/raw/master/images/manage_app.png)\r\n\r\nGo to Settings and click Reveal Config Variables\r\n\r\nCreate two configuration variables, SLACK_USER_ID and SLACK_AUTH_TOKEN\r\n\r\nPaste the credentials that were generated from Slack above.\r\n\r\n![Config Variables](https://github.com/juliangarritano/ethanifier-android/raw/master/images/app_settings.png)\r\n\r\nThat's it! You now have your very own web application.\r\n\r\n### Finishing touches\r\n\r\nCopy your heroku app domain (located in the settings screen, should be something like [your_app_name].herokuapp.com)\r\n\r\nIn `MainActivity.java` of the Android application, paste your domain name in the apiEndpoint variable:\r\n\r\n`private final String apiEndpoint = \"https://ethanifier.herokuapp.com\";`\r\n\r\nThat's it! You should now have your very own copy of Ethanifier working. Give it a try.\r\n\r\n### Adding push notifications and more features\r\n\r\nTake a look at the [SupportKit docs](http://docs.supportkit.io) to learn more about the library I used to implement the messaging functionality. It contains many more features that are really handy for any app you might be working on.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
